findings:
  successes:
    - "Meta-thinking - Recognized need for framework"
    - "Research synthesis - Combined web search with practical knowledge"
    - "Structured design - Clean separation of concerns"
    - "Practical validation - Actually booted a kernel"
  failures:
    - "Docker loop device limitations"
    - "Full rootfs creation incomplete"
  lessons:
    - "Meta-tasks are valuable - Building the test is harder than passing it"
    - "Research compounds - Web search + docs + practical tests = understanding"
    - "Docker has limits - Some OS-level tasks need real Linux"
