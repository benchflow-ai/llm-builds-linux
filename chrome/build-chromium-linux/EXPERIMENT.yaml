expected_challenges:
  - "100GB+ disk space requirement"
  - "Multi-hour build time (2-8 hours)"
  - "200+ package dependencies to install"
  - "Complex build system (depot_tools, GN, Ninja)"
  - "Long feedback loops (errors may not surface until hours into build)"
  - "Resource exhaustion (RAM, disk, CPU)"
  - "Docker resource limits and configuration"
  - "Network issues during source fetch (35GB download)"

success_criteria:
  - "Docker image builds successfully"
  - "Chromium source fetches completely (~35GB)"
  - "Build dependencies install (200+ packages)"
  - "Build configuration generates valid Ninja files"
  - "Compilation completes without fatal errors"
  - "Final binary exists at chromium/src/out/Default/chrome"
  - "Binary is executable and valid"

comparison:
  related_experiment: "chrome/build-chromium"
  platform_difference: "macOS ARM64 vs Linux x86_64"
  containerization: "Docker vs native"
  expected_differences:
    - "Linux uses Docker for isolation vs native macOS"
    - "Different dependency management (apt vs Homebrew/Xcode)"
    - "Cross-platform build system should behave similarly"
    - "Build time may vary based on container performance"

notes:
  - "This experiment has not been attempted yet"
  - "Chromium source and build artifacts are gitignored due to size (100GB+)"
  - "macOS ARM64 build (chrome/build-chromium) was successful"
  - "Linux build adds complexity of Docker containerization"
  - "Estimated total time: 4-10 hours (including source fetch and build)"
  - "Agent must manage long-running processes and resource constraints"
  - "Primary test of agent capability on extreme-difficulty build tasks"
